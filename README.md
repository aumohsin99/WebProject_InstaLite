# WebApplication

Just another try to learn django and build something useful.
So far, I have added templates and resources etc into the project.
Let's see how it goes further.


Issues to be resolved:
1. Home button displacement on Profile Page
2. Whenever a profile is reloaded instead of showing the top, it shows the posts at top
3. Settings update form needs to be in centre of the page. It's on the left side/aligned
