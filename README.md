# WebApplication

Just another try to learn django and build something useful.
So far, I have added templates and resources etc into the project.
Let's see how it goes further.


Issues to be resolved:
1. Home button displacement on Profile Page
2. Whenever a profile is visited instead of showing the top, it shows the posts at top
3. Post upload option needs to be removed from search list page and it's not working as well
4. Settings update form needs to be in centere of the page. It's on the left side/aligned
